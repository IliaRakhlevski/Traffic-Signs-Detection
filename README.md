# Traffic Signs Detection And Recognition
## Course: Selected Topics In Intelligent Systems 1
### Topic: Intelligent transportation systems

Course project: Implementation of traffic-sign detection and recognition using Mask R-CNN network.<br/>
Dataset: DFG Traffic Sign Dataset - traffic signs images in JPEG format.<br/>
Programming Language: Python 3.<br/>
Technologies/Methods: Mask R-CNN (mrcnn 0.2).<br/>
Software: Spyder 3.3.6 / IPython 7.8.0 â€“ development environment.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;VGG Image Annotator - an image annotation tool that can be used to
&emsp;&emsp;define regions in an image and create textual descriptions of those regions.
